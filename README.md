# IMDB Sentiment Analysis RNN

![](https://github.com/mertfozzy/IMDB-Sentiment-Analysis-RNN/blob/main/screenshot.png?raw=true)

This project aims to answer some questions about movies and series. 

Using Recurrent Neural Networks, it can classify good or bad user comments, also make graphs according to analysis.

## How to use :
- There is a Python file called ; "app.py". That file includes an application version of the program. It has a basic interface to manage operations.
- Also there is another file "imdb.py". That was just my workspace. It's not the main codes, just a backup.
- Before run the "app.py", you must download the libraries. In the top of the codes you can find the library names and just download them with pip commands.
- Then you download the libraries, you can run the "app.py". Program will automatically download the IMDB Dataset and be ready to use.

## Which operations are available :
### Exploratory Data Science :
- 1- Test the dataset.
- 2- Draw a graph to show distribution of words in the dataset.
- 3- How many different words are in the dataset?
- 4- Which integer corresponds to which word?
- 5- Convert an index number into corresponded comment text. (Decryption of comment)

### Machine Learning :
- 6- Start to train the model. (When you select that operation, it will start processing automatically. Algorithms will be executed by one by one. You'll be able to see all progress in terminal.)
